Purpose: A site to promote reading and writing. A platform to live unbound. 
 
This is a project of raw codeing. Everything is made from scratch. No framework,no built in plugin, no CMS is used. It is an incomplete project. I made this site from my personal interest. I tried to make it simple and light. Hopefully I will continue to work on this project again when I get some leaisure time from my study and work.
