# vaguetext.com
This is a project of raw code. It is a partial implementation which can be found at vaguetext.com. Used technologies: PHP, Mysql, Javascripts, AJAX, CSS, HTML. 

Everything is made from scratch. No framework,no built in plugin, no CMS is used. It is an incomplete project. I made this site from my personal interest. I tried to make it simple and light. Hopefully I will continue to work on this project again when I get some leaisure time from my study and work.
